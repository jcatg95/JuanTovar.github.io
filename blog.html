          <p>My path and story.</p>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
          
          I studied Economics at Universidad de Piura. During my studies, I worked as a research assistant for Martin Paredes (Ph.D. Economics, NYU) and Miguel Angel Martínez (Ph.D. Business/Managerial Economics, Pompeu Fabra) in the fields of industrial organization, game theory, organizational and managerial economics at my university’s research center. I also assisted Martín Valdivia (Ph.D. Applied Economics) on an impact evaluation study (RCT) in the field of microfinance and women empowerment.
          
          <br> </br>

          The last experience strongly motivated me to begin my career in the public sector. I first joined the Strategic Planning Office of the Ministry of Education in Peru, where I tracked and analyzed budget spending indicators for Lima, the capital and most populous city with over 10 million habitants. Since Lima concentrates more than 30% of the Peruvian students, the impact of successful education service delivery is crucial to achieve better learning outcomes at a country level. Following that experience, I joined the Ministry of Economy and Finance’s National Budget Office, where I specialized in subnational budgeting. As part of my role, I detected and seized an opportunity to automate several routinary tasks using programming tools such as Stata, Python, R and VBA.
          
          <br> </br>

          Improving these processes also allowed me to realize the difficulties of coordination across institutions. Motivated by the challenge of solving structural bottlenecks, I was requested to lead the design of a multisectoral budget program focused on early childhood development, that required involvement of over 10 Ministries, each of which held different perspectives. The design was an innovative process which created Result-Oriented Budget Programs (Programas Preuspuestales Orientados a Resultados), which were later approved via laws. Within the same field of early childhood development, we worked on an impact evaluation over anemia with administrative data; which was the first one of the Office developed inhouse.
                    
          <br> </br>

          My latest position has been as a Data Center leader for the Ministry of Economy. The role implied  assuming the leadership on Data Governance and Open Data which required alignment with most of the Ministry’s departments. The most rewarding part of the position was leading a talented and diverse team of ten, who hailed from different fields including engineering, statistics, computer science, economics, design and marketing.

          <br> </br>
          
          The lack of uniformity in the data we often processed helped me appreciate the necessity of centralized data and of a team with advanced analytic skills to administer it. Therefore, I promoted the creation of a new Information Management Office that oversaw data governance, open data, business intelligence, system development and data culture in the MEF. After its creation, I assumed the Data Center and Talent Management leader. In this capacity, I was in charge of the Data Governance and Open Data strategies, and culture and talent strategies; and gave support to the Analytics, BI and System Development teams, and other offices within the Ministry, with the objective to move towards a data-driven institution.

          <br> </br>

          The COVID-19 pandemic brought hardship and challenges to Peru’s public sector. Nevertheless, the recently created Data Center had quickly developed expertise that was useful in providing a better response. During the 2020-2021 pandemic I contributed with data based solutions that reduced infections and deaths caused by the COVID-19. In particular, I am one of the creators of a system called SISCOVID, developed jointly with the Ministry of Health; which consists of a tool to track the people from the possibility of being infected until they are recovered. Furthermore, I am also one of the creators of a data based solution to monitor agglomeration through hundreds of millions of data points from the telephone operators (national level) and security video cameras (local level) and tracking the acquisition and distribution of personal protective equipment and Covid-19 vaccines.

          <br> </br>

          The access to data is necessary in many levels for decision takers in public policy, and the sanitary emergency made it clear. Therefore, with the objective of delivering the data and information and aligned with the national digital transformation plan, considering technical and not-technical profiles of the users, I was in charge of planning and leading the development of three prioritized products. At a strategic level, I promoted and led the improvement and development of three portals in the Ministry of Economy and Finance: i) open data portal, ii) financial administration transparency portal and iii) information management tool. These three portals needed coordination with profiles from diverse fields such as: business, graphic design, user experience and interface, architecture, infrastructure, technology and web development.

          <br> </br>

          In all of my jobs, I have worked with many programming languages and softwares such as: Python for data engineering and data analytics; Stata for statistics and impact evaluation; Matlab for simulation of theoretical models; PL/SQL for feature engineering; HTML, CSS and JS for web development (front-end and back-end); Q-Gis for spatial data analysis; and Tableau for data visualization. All of these tools are circumstantial and I end up using them depending on the problem I am solving.


          <br> </br>
          
          Across my career path I realized that, whether it is a business or public policy problem, proposing evidence and data based solutions are potential game-changers. Nevertheless, project management skills and leadership skills are required to convert that potential into real game-changing solutions. My profile, with the best of both sides, will certainly locate me in the right track towards making an improvement of public policy through data.
